 [+] Guide how to compile files into exe
===========================================

  * Plan:

First we compile the game, 
and then we create an exe file that downloads 
the game, music, and creates a folder in %appdata%


  *What you need:

1) an application that can read Python. 
(In my case it was IDLE Python)
link:https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Next you will need to download additional modules:
 pip install pygame pyinstaller

3) Open Tic-Tac-Toe-1st_step

Open the bat file and it will create an exe file

4)  Open Tic-Tac-Toe-2nd_step

1. You need to put the exe file in the folder: 
"Open Tic-Tac-Toe-2nd_step" and name it: Tic Tac Toe 2.0.

2. You need to download Inno Setup
